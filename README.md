# Electron auto updater example

This is a minimal Electron application with auto updates implemented and based on the [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

## Notes
- For building the app, this example uses [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)
- If you're using OS X, you need to [sign the app](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Code-Signing)
